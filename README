controllercontroller
=======================

Sinatra server for unlimited users to control iTunes remotely. Add/remove tracks from
the playlist, browse the library, control play/pause/volume/etc.

Design
=======================
Best used in Firefox 3 or Safari. Opera is okay, but not as nice. It is passable in 
Internet Explorer, but not great. I have no plans to support IE, so you can just DEAL! haha!


Dependencies
=======================
active_support
sinatra
rb-appscript


Running
=======================

$ ruby server.rb

Then connect to http://your_ip:4567.
